            Who We Are
        </h2>
        <p>Troop 222 was chartered in May 1988 and has been 
        continuously active since its inception. Meadow Glens 
        Elementary School Home and School association charters 
        Troop 222. There are currently 45+ scouts in the Troop, 
        half of which are in high school and half in junior high. 
        Our troop has helped over 180 scouts achieve the rank of 
        Eagle Scout. Most scouts, independent of the level that 
        they achieve, learn skills, values, and self-confidence. 
        These qualities will assist the scout in every walk of life.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Our Goal
        </h2>
        <p>
            The aim of scouting is to build character, foster citizenship 
            and to develop fitness. The values that we encourage are based 
            on those found in the Scout Oath and Law. We are a very 
            goals-oriented troop and one statistic says it all: over 12% of 
            the young men that have joined Troop 222 have reached the elite 
            rank of Eagle Scout. This average is well over twice the national 
            average of 5%. The scouts run Troop 222's program with guidance 
            from the adult leaders. We believe scouting works best in an 
            outdoor environment and Troop 222 supports a strong outdoor 
            camping program.

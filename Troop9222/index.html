  <p>Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouts, once said: </p>
  <blockquote><i>“An invaluable step in character training is to put responsibility on the individual.”<br>
    "Be Prepared... the meaning of the motto is that a scout must prepare himself by previous thinking out and 
    practicing how to act on any accident or emergency so that he is never taken by surprise." </i></blockquote>
